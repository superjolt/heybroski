This is a fun ai project I made. It's an ai voice assistant.

It uses Wispr Flow, and Gemini, and Google TTS for you to speak and it to continously answer.

It has chat history, and a keyboard shortcut to activate. (Ctrl + Shift)

## To use

Press Ctrl + Shift and start speaking. The AI will respond back to you, so turn up your volume.
