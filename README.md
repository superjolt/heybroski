# heybroski

This is a fun ai project I made. It's an ai voice assistant.

It uses Wispr Flow, and Gemini, and Google TTS for you to speak and it to continously answer.

It has chat history, and a keyboard shortcut to activate. (Ctrl + Shift)

## To install and use

Go to your terminal and do these commands:

git clone https://github.com/superjolt/heybroski.git
cd heybroski
python3 record/recordaudio.py

Then, press Ctrl + Shift and start speaking. The AI will respond back to you, so turn up your volume.
Hopefully Wispr Flow's fuck ass api will not be on maintanence, if it doesn't respond back to you, I can't do anything.
